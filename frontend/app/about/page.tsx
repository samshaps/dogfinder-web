                  Hunting for the right rescue dog can feel overwhelming. Tons of new dogs get posted each day and rescues move fast! If you're not constantly scrolling rescue sites, it's easy to miss out. DogYenta fixes these issues by using the power of AI to match you with your perfect dog based on the most recent rescues. We also offer an always-on monitoring service to bring the newest matches right to your inbox.

                  The name 'Yenta' is inspired by the  matchmaker from the musical 'Fiddler on the Roof'. Just like Yenta, our platform is all about making meaningful connections. Unlike Yenta, we won't pair you up with an age-inappropriate butcher.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We believe finding the right dog is a matchmaking processâ€”a heartfelt quest to unite a loving person with their perfect canine companion. We're here to be your friendly, modern-day Yenta for dog adoption.
