# Visual Cleanup Guide

A concise specification to align inner pages with the refreshed homepage visual language.

## Global principles
- **Typography**: Use the app’s primary sans family. Bold for primary headings; comfortable line-height for body. Medium gray body text `#555555`.
- **Buttons**: Primary uses brand blue `#2563EB` background with white bold text and 8px–12px rounded corners; secondary uses white background, blue border/text. Ensure focus rings, hover/active states.
- **Cards**: White background, subtle shadow or light border, 8px radius, consistent padding and spacing.
- **Icons**: ~16px, color brand blue or medium gray; consistent style and spacing.
- **Images**: Consistent aspect ratios and rounded corners that match cards.
- **Responsiveness**: Spacing, grids, and button alignment scale cleanly from desktop → tablet → mobile.
